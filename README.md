Comparative Analysis of different classification algorithms 
Whenever we encounter a classification problem, we have a lot of classifiers to choose from. To debug this problem, we are proposing a performance metrices based classifier evaluation. We will validate the performance of algorithms using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC Curve and AUC Score.
