Comparative Analysis of different classification algorithms 

Whenever we encounter a classification problem, we have a lot of classifiers to choose from. I have chosen a dataset on which i applied different classification algorithms and also validated it using Precision, Recall, F1, ROC and AUC Curve.
I have also explained every code and result for better understanding of this problem.
